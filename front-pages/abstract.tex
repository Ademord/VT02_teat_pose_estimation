Computer vision has been a field of study since the 1960s, and over the past few years a lot of challenges, such as 2D object recognition are now considered solved problems. Nevertheless, problems like 3D object recognition are still a topic of research. 
The goal of this work is to analyze diverse methods for 3D object detection, and find an applicable solution for recognizing cow teats 90\% of the time within 10 seconds. 
The work contributed by this solution will help solving the challenges the project "Melkroboter" at the ZHAW encounters.
